This friend group was created on August 12, 2020 due to Alfonso messaging Joaqui about an interaction they had on December 4th, 2016 in a birthday party. Because of this, Joaqui and Alfonso started to hang out and eventually, started hanging out with Eugene. Then, Ricardo, Aiden, and Fred got added in the mix throughout the year.
